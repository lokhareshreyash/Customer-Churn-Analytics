Tableau dashboards analyzing customer churn for a telecom dataset. Includes KPIs, demographic analysis, contract/payment insights, and data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention.

# 📊 Customer Churn Analytics (Tableau Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.  
In this project, I analyzed the **Databel Telecom dataset** using Tableau to uncover key factors behind customer attrition.  

The analysis highlights **why customers churn** (not just how many), providing insights into retention strategies for telecom businesses.

## 📊 Dashboards

### 1. Overview Dashboard
- KPIs: Total customers, churned customers, churn rate.  
- Major churn drivers: competitor offers (17.13%), competitor had better devices (16.79%), attitude of support person (11.48%).  
- **Filters**: contract type, gender, churn category.  
- **Insight**: Most churn is driven by **competitor advantage**.  

### 2. Age Brackets & Groups
- Analyzed churn across **age groups & customer groups (2–6 people)**.  
- Linked churn with **monthly charges** and **age bins**.  
- **Insight**: Seniors and people with no groups showed **higher churn rates**, especially in age 60–75.  

### 3. Data & International Plan
- Compared churn between **Intl. Plan vs. No Intl. Plan** customers.  
- Evaluated **extra charges (data/international)** and **usage (Intl. vs Local minutes)**.  
- **Insight**: Customers with international plans and those with higher extra charges had **increased churn**.  

### 4. Payment Method & Contract Type
- Examined churn based on **contract type** (Month-to-Month, One-Year, Two-Year).  
- Compared across **payment methods**.  
- **Insight**: **Month-to-Month contracts** had the **highest churn**, while longer-term contracts improved retention.
